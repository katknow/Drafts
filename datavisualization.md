# Data Visualization
The Data Visualization module does/offers XYZ. With this module, site administrators are able to generate datasets and render diagrams that reflect their data. Then, end users will X.

Once activated on the modules tab of the admin dashboard, Data Visualization is managed on site by site basis. 

## Creating Data Visualizations
If the Data Visualization module is active, a tab for Data Visualization will appear in the menu for individual sites. Clicking this tab will take you to a list of all visualizations created for the site. You can sort the visualizations by either date or title in ascending or descending order.

## Adding a Data Visualization to the Site Navigation
After clicking the Data Visualization tab, you can create a new visualization by clicking the *Add new visualization* button.

You will then have the option select what you would like to visualize. The five options include:
1. Count of items in item set, which visualizes the count of items that are assigned to selected item sets;
2. Count of items with classes, which visualizes the count of items that are instances of selected resource classes;
3. Count of items with properties, which visualizes the count of items that have selected properties;
4. Count of items with property values, which visualizes the count of items that have selected values of a selected property; 
5. County of property values, which visualizes the count of values of a selected property.

Once you select what you would like to visualize, click the *Next* button. You will then be on the "Add visualization" page. 

The title field is required, but the description will be included below the title of your visualization on the public facing page if you wish to include it. The search query will help narrow down the items that will be used in your data set. If you choose to leave this blank, the visualization will incorporate all items assigned to that site.

### Data Configuration

### Diagram Configuration

Under Diagram Configuration, you will be able to select the kind of diagram you would like to produce for your visualization. Options include bar chart, column chart, and pie chart. If you edit your visualization to change the Diagram Configuration after your initial visualization is produced, you will lose your current diagram configuration.
