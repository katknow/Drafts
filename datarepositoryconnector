# Data Repository Connector

This module will allow users to import records and/or data files from several different data repository platforms: Dataverse, Zenodo & CKAN.

Dataverse: you can find many Dataverse instances to test with at the bottom of this page: https://dataverse.org/metrics . You can usually find sub-'Dataverses' under the main instance from the search/browse page. The 'Dataverse Identifier' field in the module will be the string after '/dataverse/' in the sub-dataverse URL.
Zenodo: Zenodo is one large shared repository; you can find the sub-'Communities' here: https://zenodo.org/communities/ . Again, the 'Zenodo Community ID' is found at the end of a communities URL
CKAN: Used for large consortium, usually governmental data collections. You can find some examples here: https://ckan.org . I've been testing with US and Canada but feel free to try others. On most instances, clicking the search button with no input will return all records, then 'CKAN Organizations' can be found in the left sidebar. Once in an organization, the value you want follows 'organization=' in the URL

Testing Tasks

For each service

Test importing collections of various sizes, adjusting all configuration parameters and making sure they are reflected in the imported collection
Test importing files into Omeka S. Note that many data file formats aren't on the list of supported media types/extensions in the Omeka S settings--this may cause an import error in which case you'll have to add the extensions/media types manually, or choose another collection
If several metadata formats are available, try importing with all of them and ensure they show up accurately in the Omeka S item record
(Dataverse/CKAN) Test importing an entire Dataverse or CKAN instance by not entering an identifier or organization when importing. Try to pick a smaller instance, one with less than 500 items if possible (might not be possible with CKAN). If encountering issues, try lowering the 'Limit' setting
Test undoing an import for each Data Repository service
