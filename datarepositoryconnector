### Checking Import Status

After you have hit submit, you can track the status of the import by navigating to the Data Repository Connector > Past Imports tab or the Jobs tab of the left-hand navigation on the admin dashboard.

+ Are your jobs starting and not completing? You might need to set the path for PHP so that your system can perform the background process to make the items.

## Review Imports

Go to the Data Repository Connector tab on the left-hand navigation of the admin dashboard, click on Data Repository Connector and then click on Past Imports, which should appear below the Data Repository Connector tab.

This page displays a table of Past Imports, with a checkbox option to Undo, the Job ID for the import, any Comments made during import, the number of Items imported, the Date of the import, the import Status, and the Owner, or user who initiated the import.

## Update Imported Resources

To update resources created using the Data Repository Connector, simply re-run an import from the same source. The resources will be updated, not reimported. This allows you to use the Connector to sync data between your Data Repository and Omeka S installations.

## Undo an Import

To undo a completed import and remove all associated items, go to the Data Repository Connector tab on the left-hand navigation of the admin dashboard, click on Data Repository Connector and then click on Past Imports, which should appear below the Data Repository Connector tab.

Check the box for each import you wish to undo and click submit.
